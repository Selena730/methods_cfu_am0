# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of? I am really proud of myself because I remembered everything I learned in Mod 0 and I was able to search more effectively and more easily.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications? It allows us to reuse the code without the need to rewrite it and the code becomes easier to read.
